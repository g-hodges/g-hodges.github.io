      <description>In 2017, Calabrio acquired an analytics and data visualization software company. At the time, customers had access to a limited set of documentation published on Confluence. The space was maintained by developers and product management. As the technical writer for this project, I reviewed published and unpublished content to develop a strategy and migrate content to MadCap Flare.
The functionality of the reports drove most of the demand for this software.</description>
