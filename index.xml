      <description>Addressed pretty significant page load performance issue founde in larger deployments. Eliminates uses of intensive backend query, replacing it with an asynchronous API call against a lucene index. This change reduces page load from from 2+ minutes to nearly instant, with an incredibly responsive UI.</description>

      <title>Added Docker Build Status Badge to shields.io</title>
      <link>localhost:1313/projects/contributions/shields-docker/</link>

      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc).Â Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>While adding Structured Data to a client&amp;rsquo;s website I found some example JSON that was invalid. Simple contribution to cleanup the user documentation providing syntactically valid JSON documents.</description>

      <title>Forcing Visits to use SSL</title>

      <description>Intro Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s a CakePHP app for a client, your own personal CMS, or any other web based application. If your passing around passwords or other sensitive info you should really implement SSL. SSL provides 2 main perks to your visitors.
 First it encrypts all communication that flies across the web. This prevents curious or devious billies from getting your secrets. Secondly it ensures to the user that your server is in fact who it claims, and not a nasty &amp;lsquo;man in the middle&amp;quot; attack.</description>

      <description>The functionality of the reports drove most of the demand for this software. I provided a brief explanation of report creation. The content structure was determined by the existing style of the Confluence space and Calabrio style.</description>

      <description>As with most ML features, the difficult technology remains unseen by the user. A large part of my work involved using minimalist writing techniques to provide only what the user needed when they needed it. This involved brokering a compromise regarding what information is available to the different audiences involved in the project: end-user, customer administrator, and internal audiences (development, support, etc.).</description>

      <title>Message Queue Service</title>

      <description>A feature development team that I worked with at Cherwell replaced the message queue service with an open source option. After starting as a couple small topics to describe the implementation by development, the support team noticed repeated questions in customer calls. To reduce the number of support calls, I made iterative changes to the documentation to dig deeper into this application. The documentation set for this project evolved to encompass multiple configuration, and troubleshooting topics.</description>

      <description>This topic introduces the procedure for report creation in Calabrio Advanced Reporting. The information addresses an elementary step in using the reporting software.

      <description>This file exists solely to respond to /search URL with the related search layout template.
No content shown here is rendered, all content is based in the template layouts/page/search.html
Setting a very low sitemap priority will tell search engines this is not important content.
This implementation uses Fusejs, jquery and mark.js
Initial setup Search depends on additional output content type of JSON in config.toml
[outputs] home = [&amp;#34;HTML&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;JSON&amp;#34;] Searching additional fileds To search additional fields defined in front matter, you must add it in 2 places.</description>
