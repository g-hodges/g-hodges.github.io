      <description>In 2017, Calabrio acquired an analytics and data visualization software company. At the time, customers had access to a limited set of documentation published on Confluence. The space was maintained by developers and product management. As the technical writer for this project, I reviewed published and unpublished content to develop a strategy and migrate content to MadCap Flare.
The functionality of the reports drove most of the demand for this software.</description>

      <description>A feature development team that I worked with at Cherwell replaced the message queue service with an open source option. After starting as a couple small topics to describe the implementation by development, the support team noticed repeated questions in customer calls. To reduce the number of support calls, I made iterative changes to the documentation to dig deeper into this application.

      <description>This topic worked in tandem with the conceptual &amp;ldquo;Understanding reports&amp;rdquo; topic to fill a gap in the reporting documentation.
